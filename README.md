This Git repository serves as an archive for all the solutions to the exercises covered in the JS Applications course at SoftUni in January 2023. The course covers a range of topics related to JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, routing, and more.

The repository is organized by module, with each module containing a separate directory for the corresponding exercises. The solutions are provided in JavaScript files, each of which is named according to the exercise it solves.

This repository is designed to be a comprehensive resource for students to refer to as they work through the course, providing them with a convenient way to access and review the solutions to each exercise. Additionally, it can be used by other developers as a reference or a source of inspiration for similar projects.
